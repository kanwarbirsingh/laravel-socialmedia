# laravel-socialmedia
A Social Media App based in Laravel 5.4

Inspired from Youtube tutorial series at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51oloSGk5XdO2MGjPqc0BxGV by Academind(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w)

Really great tutorial series !!!

Code for this youtube series can be found at https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/laravel-basics-youtube

Although, the series uses Laravel 5.2, but this project is developed in Laravel 5.4. I did not clone the github repository for this series, but followed the tutorial series and developed along the way.

There are some changes in both the versions which posed some problems while following the series. I documented the changes along the way which were appropriate in my case, but might not be for others.

Also,I used a Laravel debugging package for this project after doing some research on Laravel debuggers. I used Laravel Debugbar package by Barry vd. Heuvel present at https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar/tree/2.4. Because this project uses Laravel 5.4, it is imperative to use Branch 2.4 for Laravel Debugbar as Laravel >5.5 versions use the latest release and Laravel <5.4 versions use 2.4 branch.

Specs:
OS: Windows 10
Stack: WAMP 3.1.19(64-bit)
IDE: VS Code

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
